# MicroStar V1

Created for my Master Thesis at Leiden University.

MicroStar is a DRL implementation for unit micro in SC2. Its general architecture is inpired by DeepMinds AlphaStar but with many changes since its only goal is unit control and not full length games.

This repo/code is still somewhat messy.

The MicroStar implementation can be found in models/MicroStar.py.
